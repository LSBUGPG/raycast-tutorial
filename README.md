# Raycast Tutorial

This tutorial covers how to use Unity's raycast feature to make a laser pointer

## Prerequisites

Before approaching this tutorial, you will need a current version of Unity and a code editor (such as Microsoft Visual Studio Community) installed and ready to use.

This tutorial was created with Unity 2022.3 LTS and Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 versions. It should work with earlier or later versions. But you should check the release notes for other versions as the Editor controls or Scripting API functions may have changed.

If you need help installing Unity you can find many online tutorials such as:

You will also need to know how to create an empty project, add primitive objects to your scene, create materials, create blank scripts, and run projects from within the editor. If you need help with this, there is a short video demonstrating how to do most of these things here:
